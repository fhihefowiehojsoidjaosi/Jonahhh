you must extract all files from the zip for image searching to work
shift lock must be enabled (doesnt have to be on. just enabled)
designed for 28 movespeed but can be run at higher or lower

if the macro only spins around your camera at hive, 
the image searches are not working. try these few things:
- make sure all files have been extracted
- select a graphics setting and resolution setting in the gui
- adjust your own graphics settings on the roblox client
if that fails, you would have to replace the image files in the
image assets with your own
